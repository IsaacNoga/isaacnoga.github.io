# Isaac's Log.

## 2nd Week 1st Blog. 

This second week came with a lot of challenges for me, but also gave me the opportunity to obtain new perspectives. 
I'm used to taking classes where the main objective was to understand the logic part of a program or to 
understand a process.  

But going into Encora's program helped me to understand that there's more skills to develop than technical stuff. 

One of the main habits that I needed to develop was the habit of reading, and this week came with a lecture to be able
to develop it.

The book Code: The Hidden Lenguage of Computer Hardware & Software by Charles Petzold opens with a short story about
two boys. As friends they constantly go out and play, when there's time to go back to home they grab a computer and 
chat for a few minutes, but as kids they have schedules for bed time, just as when we were kids we didn't wanted the 
fun to be over, so sometimes we found ways of keep playing past bedtime, just as we did the kids in this story found 
a way to communicate.
