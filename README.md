# Isaac's Log.

## 2nd Week 1st Blog. 

This second week came with a lot of challenges for me, but also gave me the opportunity to obtain new perspectives. 
I'm used to taking classes where the main objective was to understand the logic part of a program or to 
understand a process.  

But going into Encora's program helped me to understand that there's more skills to develop than technical stuff. 

One of the main habits that I needed to develop was the habit of reading, and this week came with a lecture to be able
to develop it.

The book Code: The Hidden Lenguage of Computer Hardware & Software by Charles Petzold opens with a short story about
two boys. As friends they constantly go out and play, when there's time to go back to home they grab a computer and 
chat for a few minutes, but as kids they have schedules for bed time, just as when we were kids we didn't wanted the 
fun to be over, so sometimes we found ways of keep playing past bedtime, just as we did. The kids in this story found 
a way to communicate.

They started to use flashlights, pointing them to a window they managed to create a code for some words, a vertical stroke 
of the flashlight meant a yes, and a circular stroke meant a no.
This and some other words where simplified, but later on, they found out that there will be a problem on how the light 
worked and the speed of the words they could describe. This leads to the kids trying to use blinks of the flashlight to 
communicate. From one blink to A to 24 for Z.
This is just a clear example of how we, human beings, are constantly trying to find new ways to communicate with each other in 
different forms, sometimes through speaking, sometimes through text.

These forms can be seen as codes. 

The language itself can be seen as a code where it has rules and structures so it can be understood by the speakers. 
Without any of the structures that composes it there wouldn't be any communication. 

For the first 4 chapters this book focuses on letting us understand that code is more present in our lives than what we 
are actually aware of. We are constantly making use of it and it has grown in so many ways just to help us find different 
ways to express things. 

This book from starters has taken my attention and I hope to make this into a habit.
