# Isaac's Log.

## 2nd Week 1st Blog. 

This second week came with a lot of challenges for me, but also gave me the opportunity to obtain new perspectives. 
I'm used to taking classes where the main objective was to understand the logic part of a program or to 
understand a process.  

But going into Encora's program helped me to understand that there's more skills to develop than technical stuff. 

One of the main habits that I needed to develop was the habit of reading, and this week came with a lecture to be able
to develop it.
